This file is intended primarily for a CUSTOM STEAM DECK WITH ARCH, NOT THE STEAM OS. It might be possible to make it work on the stock one, but I can't be sure. 
I will not include the Fallout 3 background image or the looping title menu video for space and copyright reasons.
You must install several packages to get this working if you don't already have them. Otherwise it will give you errors when you do the test run.
Be sure to rename the files correctly and adjust the video settings for your monitors. 
Enjoy fellow wasteland travelers.
